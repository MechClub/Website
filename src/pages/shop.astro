<p class="text-mech-500 leading-10 pb-4 text-justify">Mechanical engineering students have access to rent lockers on campus in three different locations! Lockers are assigned on a first-come first-served basis but student preference is taken into consideration. Lockers are sold by the Mechanical Engineering Club for $25 for Mech students and $30 for non-Mech students. We accept applications at any point during the school year and they are currently being rented for the entire 2023/24 year (includes Fall, Winter, and Summer sessions). Students must supply their own locks and are responsible for clearing out their belongings at the end of their rental period.
