      <ol class="list-inside list-decimal py-2">
        <li>Does what I‚Äôm hearing in my head create a negative emotion in my mind?</li>
        <li>Why is this thought making me feel a negative emotion?</li>
        <li>Does this thought make sense?</li>

      <br/>
      <br/>
      <span class="bg-clip-text text-2xl">Try the following:</span>

        <li>Listen to your favourite songs</li>
        <li>Talk to loved ones</li>
        <li>Do a fun activity</li>
        <li>Purchase a fidget toy (e.g. fidget spinner, tangle, rubik‚Äôs cube, putty, spaghetti ball, stress ball, flappy chain)</li>
        <li>Invest time into mindful minutes, a helpful tool includes the mobile app ‚ÄúHeadspace‚Äù</li>
      <li>Read a book</li>
      </ol>
    <span class="font-bold">Remember, a proven way to quickly get rid of stress is to maximize time in a ‚Äúflow‚Äù activity - any activity where you feel completely immersed throughout.</span>
